# pit

pit Is a template based on our previous experiences.
The structure is heavily base on [Devcards template](https://github.com/bhauman/devcards-template) made by [Bruce Hauman](https://github.com/bhauman/).

## Usage

The template is not *yet* deployed on Clojars.
In order to use it, clone it and type:
```bash
cd pit
lein new pit {{project-name}}
```
